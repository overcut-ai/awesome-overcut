## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Database**: Added a unique constraint on `phoneNumber` column of the `Customer` table (Prisma schema & migration).
- **API**: Implemented application-level handling for duplicate phone numbers – requests that attempt to create a customer with an existing `phoneNumber` now return **HTTP 409 Conflict** (error code `DuplicatePhoneNumberError`).
- **Validation**: `CustomerCreateInput` now validates that `phoneNumber` is non-empty and matches the expected numeric pattern.
- **Testing**: Added unit and integration tests covering duplicate phone number scenarios.

### Changed
- Updated Swagger / DTO documentation to indicate that `phoneNumber` must be unique.

### Fixed
- Prevented accidental creation of multiple customers with the same `phoneNumber`.
